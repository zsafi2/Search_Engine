Project Summary
Search engines are one of the most influential developments of the modern internet age, having completely revolutionized the way that people use and interact with the web. What was once an intractable jumble of data with no semblance of organization has been transformed into an easily searchable repository of information. In this project, you will recreate this phenomenal technological development by using the map and set abstractions to build a document search engine that can find matching pages for a user's query with lightning-fast response time. This is a simplified version of the technology underpinning Spotlight, Google, Bing, and every other modern search engine that you encounter in your day-to-day internet use.


In our version of the search engine, each web page has a URL ("Uniform Resource Locator") that serves as its unique id and a string containing the body text of the page. The magic of search is enabled by pre-processing the body text of each page and storing the contents into a data structure optimized for fast retrieval of pages matching the search query.


You will first write functions that process the body text and populate the data structure. Next you'll implement the function to search for pages matching a search query. Finally, you will write a console program that allows the user to enter many search queries and retrieve the matching web pages. Put all together, you will have built your own mini search engine!
